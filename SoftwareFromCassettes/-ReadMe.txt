Thanks to Jon Green for providing audio files from cassettes he obtained
with an SWTPC 6800 he purchased. Pictures of these cassettes are the
.JPG files in this folder.

Data from the audio files has been extracted into S-Record files with a
.S19 extension. The programs Battleship, Black Jack, Hangman, and
Tic-Tac-Toe can be loaded through the console serial port as S-Records
using the "L" command. Execute with the "G" command after loading.

Hangman was designed to run under the RT68 ROM instead of MIKBUG/SWTBUG
but has been patched to run without RT68. LANDER is available in assembly
source form and requires the RT68 ROM to execute.

Clean KCS format (300 baud) audio files have been re-generated from the
S-Record files so you can load these programs through the cassette
interface if you want.
